    <p class="alert">On Dec 31, 2016, Instinct will be shutting down.</p>
    <p>
      It's been a great run, and the time has come to retire the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinct began as a labor of love, raised money as a startup,
      and then became a labor of love again when we couldn't make the business work.
      We stopped updating the site a few years ago as our lives and jobs became busy.
      But people kept using it and we believed in the product, so we kept the site running.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the software ages, it's only a matter of time before it needs real maintenance.
      But as founders, we've moved on with our lives. We don't have it in our hearts to do that work. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So we're closing the site at the end of the year and trying, as we always have, to take care of our users.
      If you recently purchased any of our courses, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hello@getinstinct.com">hello@getinstinct.com</a> and we will gladly send you a refund.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're trying to learn music, there are some great sites out there.
      For guitar, we highly recommend <a href="https://soundslice.com">Soundslice</a>. For piano, we highly recommend <a href="http://flowkey.com">Flowkey</a>.
      They are inspired products with great founders, and we think theyâ€™ll serve you well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks so much for all the love and support over the years. We say goodbye with a heavy heart and a lot of gratitude!
    </p>
    <p>
      All the best,<br/>
      Blake & Brian
